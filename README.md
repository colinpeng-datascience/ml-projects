# Machine Learning Project Reports

This repository contains reports of various machine learning projects covering different topics and methods. Each report is present in PDF format. Following are the details of the individual reports:


## ELL English Essay Grading - Natural Language Programming
**Title:** EECS 595 Final Project Report: AES (Automatic Essay Scoring) for ELLs (English Language Learners)\
**Co-authors:** Suhyun Jung, Youngmin Kim\
**Abstract:** Our project focuses on building a model for scoring essays written by English Language Learners by considering various scores like cohesion, syntax, vocabulary, phraseology, grammar, conventions, and more. The combined model, developed through a novel two-step method, achieved an average QWK (Quadratic Weighted Kappa) of 0.669.

## LiDAR-SLAM with Semantic Segmentation - Directed Study
**Title:** Improving LONER with Semantic Segmentation\
**Abstract:** LONER is a real-time LiDAR SLAM algorithm that utilizes NeRF. We proposed an enhancement for LONER with the incorporation of SalsaNext, a state-of-the-art real-time Lidar semantic segmentation model. Our results indicate improvements in trajectory estimation, notably in scenarios with significant car movements.

## Predicting Student Performance - Machine Learning
**Title:** Predicting Student Performance in Game-based Learning\
**Co-authors:** Yonnie Chan, Chi-Hsiang Yi, Ping-Lun Lai\
**Abstract:** This project focuses on predicting the outcome of gameplay from gaming logs using Machine Learning classifiers, specifically in the context of the Jo Wilder game developed by PBS Education. Our best model achieves an F1 score of 0.808 on unseen data.

## Modeling Crime Rates - Bayesian Modeling
**Title:** Modeling and Predicting Crime Rates in Chicago Using Bayesian Models\
**Co-authors:** Yonnie Chan, Youngmin Kim\
**Problem Statement:** The goal is to predict the crime rate of each sector in Chicago using Bayesian models. The study aims to understand the distribution of crimes across the sectors of Chicago and during different months.
